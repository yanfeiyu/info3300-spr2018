<p id="p4">Question 4:course policy<br>
    The policy for late assignments is not allowed and will result in a zero score. We should also make sure the assignments we turned in are readable. For unreadable work, the teaching stuff will accept it in rare cases where the file is timestamped in a way that is not in our own control, excluding the "last modified" date in our laptop.
